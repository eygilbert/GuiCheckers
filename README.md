# GuiCheckers
12/22/2020: Note that this project has been superseded by a much stronger version with a neural network evaluation. See https://github.com/eygilbert/GuiNN_Checkers.

GuiCheckers is a checkers program written by Jon Kreuzer. It is probably the strongest open source checkers program. It runs on Windows, and can run stand-alone with its own UI or as a CheckerBoard DLL. There is a project file for compiling it with VS2015. Jon has stopped developing it, and I have made some minor changes to it integrate it better with CheckerBoard, so I have created this GitHub repos to make the updated sources available.

GuiCheckers can use a 6-piece DTW endgame database that was created by Ed Trice. The files are too large to host on GitHub. You can find an install file for the GuiCheckers 64-bit DLL and the 6-piece DTW db here: https://mega.nz/#F!3MBAQDoa!vUZo-kItopg6LO-wPdspBw
